## Goodreads Spoiler Detection using Natural Language Processing

### Problem Statement

Goodreads is an American social cataloging website and a subsidiary of Amazon that allows individuals to search its database of books, annotations, quotes, and reviews. Whenever a user clicks on the Buy button on a Goodreads book page, they would notice that there are affiliate codes attached. Goodreads receives a royalty from any book sold through partners like Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and Apple Books. Reviews and word of mouth play a very crucial role in dictating the sales of books through the platform. 

Spoilers in book reviews can be a major interruption to a user's interest towards any book and potentially lead to loss of sales for the company. While goodreads has a user triggered flag to mark their reviwes containing spoilers, there is no way to monitor the accuracy of this process. Therefore, the main objective of this project is to perform automated spoiler detection using machine learning.
